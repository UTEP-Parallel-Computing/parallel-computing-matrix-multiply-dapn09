# Parallel Computing Matrix Multiply Assignment

Daniel Pacheco #80451020

## About

This script will implement a proof of concept script that generates and multiplies two matrices in a serial fashion (not parallel).
Once the code finishes executing it will print to console a brief report of the results similar to this:

```
MatrixA shape: (250, 250)
MatrixA subarray:
7 7
7 7

MatrixB shape: (250, 250)
MatrixB subarray:
6 6
6 6

Expected result matrix shape: (250, 250)
Actual result matrix shape: (250, 250)
Computation Time: 12.576 seconds
Result matrix subarray:
42 42
42 42
```

## To Run

To run the script:

```
$ cd parallel-computing-matrix-multiply-dapn09
$ python multiply.py
```


##### Instructions

This repository contains some basic Python utilities for
matrix operations. This is also the repository where
you will submit the assignment.

Once completed the repository should contain your code,
a short report, and any instructions needed to run your
code.
